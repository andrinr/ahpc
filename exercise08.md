# Exercise 08

## Task 1 

Look at the `loadParticles` function found in [helpers.cxx](mass_assignment/src/helpers.cxx).

## Task 2

Look at the `loadParticles` function found in [helpers.cxx](mass_assignment/src/helpers.cxx).

## Task 3

Look at the `sortParticles` function found in [helpers.cxx](mass_assignment/src/helpers.cxx).


## Task 4

Look at the `reshuffleParticles` function found in [helpers.cxx](mass_assignment/src/helpers.cxx).

## Task 5

Look at the `assign` function found in [helpers.cxx](mass_assignment/src/helpers.cxx).

## Task 6

Found in [main.cxx](mass_assignment/src/main.cxx).

## Task 7

Look at the function `bin` in [helpers.cxx](mass_assignment/src/main.cxx).

## Task 8

I have tried to solve this as seen in [main.cxx](mass_assignment/src/main.cxx).
I use the approach where I do not initially change the particle distribution amog the processes but rather I just "reduce" the ghost cells among the processors and then continue with a grid witout the ghost cells.

However I got stuck while creating the mpi custom data lauyouts.
